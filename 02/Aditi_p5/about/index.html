        <h1>Hi, I'm Aditi!</h1>
        <h2>A yoga enthusiast by dawn and a designer till dusk.</h2>
         <p>I currently study Product Design with a minor in
        creative coding at Parsons. I have a self-motivated and
        keen drive towards exploring different materials and
        processes to create timeless and meaningful products.
        Through my work, I not only aim to bridge technology,
        craft and culture but I also strive to design responsibly
        and sustainably. I am ceaselessly experimenting and
        searching for challenges whether it is inventing a new
        type of product, or trying to outrun my dog.
