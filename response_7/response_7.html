        <h1>JÃ¼rg Lehni talks with Philippe Cao and Daniel Giuditta</h1>
        <h2>1. I find the concept of looking at code as a form of poetry extremely interesting because poetry normally has a strong semantic content and is an expression of feeling. Code, on the other hand has a very functional component to it. Can this be similar to the concept of art and design, where design can be art but had the addition of functionality and user study?

        <h2>2. To what extent does technology inspire creativity and thinking differently versus hinder it?
