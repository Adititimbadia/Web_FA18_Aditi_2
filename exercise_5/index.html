            <p class="description">I currently study Product Design with a minor in creative coding at Parsons. I have a self-motivated and keen drive towards exploring different materials and processes to create timeless and meaningful products. Through my work, I not only aim to bridge technology, craft and culture but I also strive to design responsibly and sustainably.  I am ceaselessly experimenting and searching for challenges whether it is inventing a new type of product, or trying to outrun my dog.
