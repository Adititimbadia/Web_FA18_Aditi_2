        <h1>A Handmade Web â€” Carpenter</h1>
        <h2>I agree with Anil Dash on his view that having large corporations that holds sites for people as a loss of individuality, however it gives more people a platform to show their personality, philosophy and work online without understanding code. This refers back to an earlier reading by Michael Rock of how necessary it is to have a unique website that shows off your individuality versus having a simpler one that is straight to the point and focuses on your work?
